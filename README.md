# RoboDoc
Implementation of a simulation framework in the robotics software V-REP for the evaluation of the task-specific dexterity of kinematic structures.

The simulation file 6DOFSimulator.ttt can be run in V-REP as is. 
6DOFGenerator.txt is an example of a short lua script which manages the simulation setup and the creation of a example kinematic structure. It can be executed via the V-REP console. In order ensure functionality, the paths to the model files have to be changed accordingly.
